       " She came into the bar that first Saturday wearing red slacks and white high heels, looking good and smelling even better.,\n",
       "  \"Draft.\",\n",
       "  Her voice was top shelf bourbon, deep amber, smooth and mellow.,\n",
       " She sounded like someone used to being listened to.,\n",
       "  I got her a mug of beer and watched her drink while I tended bar.,\n",
       " Saturday afternoons are pretty busy around here; folks stop in and have a couple, then go on about their shopping or whatever.,\n",
       "   Dad bought this place from Jim Parker about forty years ago and let Mom name it and do the decorating.,\n",
       " It's still called Kitty Korner and there are ceramic cats everywhere.,\n",
       " I never have liked it, but who am I to change what's become a town institution?,\n",
       "  After Dad died and Mom went to the nursing home, I bought my sister out and Kitty Korner's all mine now.,\n",
       " There used to be a laundromat next door, but I bought that, too; put in a couple pool tables and a dance floor.,\n",
       " I turn a fair profit.,\n",
       "  \"Hey, Jack.\",\n",
       "  The back door slammed against the afternoon sun, letting Bud and Virginia in.,\n",
       " It's regulars like these two that keep me in business.,\n",
       "  Bud's a little weasel of a man, dark and greasy in a diesel mechanic kind of way.,\n",
       " Virginia's on the housekeeping staff at the hospital, a tiny brown mouse.,\n",
       " She wears smocks and walks uphill, even on flat land.,\n",
       " They keep an apartment above the bank across the street.,\n",
       "  Two long-necked Stroh's, two glasses of ice.,\n",
       " \"What flavor?\",\n",
       "  I'd gotten in a sample case of flavored schnapps about a month ago, and Virginia liked to sample things.,\n",

       "  Some people like them frosted and others keep the same one all night.,\n",
       "  \"Yes, please.\",\n",
       "  Her eyes made me think of the storms we get in August, dark gray and powerful.,\n",
       " Her smile was like the rainbows after, always unexpected and awfully pretty.,\n",
       "   She had two more before she left, and I didn't know any more about her that when she'd come in.,\n",
       " That, in itself, made her odd.,\n",
       " Women usually get chatty after a couple beers, and strangers like to talk about themselves.,\n",
       " A strange woman in the Kitty Korner, alone -- well, that was almost unheard of.,\n",

       " He was right, I never did.,\n",
       " I'm too old now to think about it any more.,\n",
       " I'll be 48 next fall.,\n",
       "  Dad was right about most things.,\n",
       " Just before he died, he said to me one morning, \"You'll have to take care of your mother when I'm gone.,\n",

       "'DREAM GIRL  by Melina Huddy  She reminded me of someone that I\\'d known once, but I couldn\\'t recall who. Dad bought this place from Jim Parker about forty years ago and let Mom name it and do the decorating. Her eyes made me think of the storms we get in August, dark gray and powerful. She had two more before she left, and I didn\\'t know any more about her that when she\\'d come in. I locked the doors at 2:05, with nobody left but Bud, Virginia and me. *  *  *   I drove home in the hazy darkness and was glad to see the light on in the kitchen. I\\'d been looking for her car, but hadn\\'t seen it anywhere and decided that I\\'d never see her again. Just heard Pops talk about how much your mother changed the place, made it fit for ladies, Ma says. If she\\'d been to the Johnson\\'s more than once and Ed hadn\\'t found out anything about her, well, \"No reason, Ed. *  *  *  On Saturday I caught myself watching, listening for her footsteps, turning when I heard the door.'"
